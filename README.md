## Objective

The Python code implements two different querying models, NxN and N+N, for retrieving seller product catalogs and consolidating them for buyers. These models are designed to compare performance and execution time when multiple buyers query seller product data.

## Key Functions

### 1. `get_db_connection()`
This function establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the `pymysql` library. The connection details (e.g., host, user, password, and database name) are hardcoded. The cursor class used is `DictCursor` to fetch query results as dictionaries for easy access.

### 2. `fetch_seller_catalogs()`
This function retrieves product catalogs for each seller in the database:
- Queries the `Sellers` table to fetch all sellers.
- Iterates through each seller to fetch their product catalog by querying `Products`, `Categories`, and `ProductInventory` tables.
- Builds a dictionary mapping seller names to their product catalogs.
- Closes the database connection before returning the data.

### 3. `nxn_query(buyers, sellers)`
Implements the NxN model, where each buyer queries every seller individually:
- Loops through all buyers and sellers.
- Appends the products from each sellerâ€™s catalog to a results list.
- Prints a message for each query operation.

### 4. `n_plus_n_query(buyers)`
Implements the N+N model, where a consolidated product catalog is built first:
- Calls `fetch_seller_catalogs()` to retrieve all seller catalogs.
- Uses `consolidate_catalogs()` to create a Global Catalog Repository (GCR).
- Each buyer queries this single consolidated catalog.
- Appends the GCR to the results list for all buyers.

### 5. `consolidate_catalogs(sellers)`
- Combines all individual seller catalogs into a single list of products.

### 6. `Main Execution Flow`
- Buyers are defined as a list of strings (e.g., "Buyer A", "Buyer B", etc.).
- Execution times for both models (NxN and N+N) are measured and compared.
- Results of both models are printed for inspection.

## Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:

### 1. Categories
- `CategoryID` (Primary Key)
- `CategoryName`
- `CategoryDescription`
- `CreatedAt`

### 2. CatalogSettings
- `SettingID` (Primary Key)
- `SettingName`
- `SettingValue`
- `CreatedAt`

### 3. Sellers
- `SellerID` (Primary Key)
- `SellerName`
- `Email` (Unique)
- `Password`
- `CreatedAt`

### 4. Products
- `ProductID` (Primary Key)
- `ProductName`
- `Description`
- `Price`
- `CategoryID` (Foreign Key referencing `Categories`)
- `CreatedAt`

### 5. ProductInventory
- `InventoryID` (Primary Key)
- `ProductID` (Foreign Key referencing `Products`)
- `SellerID` (Foreign Key referencing `Sellers`)
- `Quantity`
- `CreatedAt`

### 6. Orders
- `OrderID` (Primary Key)
- `SellerID` (Foreign Key referencing `Sellers`)
- `OrderDate`
- `Total`

### 7. OrderItems
- `OrderItemID` (Primary Key)
- `OrderID` (Foreign Key referencing `Orders`)
- `ProductID` (Foreign Key referencing `Products`)
- `Quantity`

## Performance Comparison

### NxN Model
- Each buyer queries every seller individually.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M), where N = number of buyers and M = number of sellers.

### N+N Model
- A consolidated catalog (GCR) is created once and queried by all buyers.
- **Time Complexity:** O(M + N), where M = number of sellers and N = number of buyers.

---

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### NxN Model

#### Advantages:
- Each buyer queries sellers directly, allowing for tailored and specific data retrieval.
- No need for a central repository.

#### Disadvantages:
- High query overhead due to repeated operations.
- Slower execution for larger datasets and more buyers.

### N+N Model

#### Advantages:
- Faster execution by consolidating catalogs into a GCR.
- Reduced database queries.

#### Disadvantages:
- Additional memory required for the GCR.
- Assumes that all buyers require access to the entire catalog.

## Output

### 1. Execution Time
- **NxN Model:** Prints the time taken for NxN queries.
- **N+N Model:** Prints the time taken for N+N queries.

### 2. Query Results
- Lists the product details retrieved by both models.

## Conclusion
The following project was built using Python and MySQL and was run on a system running windows 11 Pro with a Core i9-12900H CPU (14 Cores, 20 Logical processors) with 16GB RAM.
This code provides a comparative analysis of two query models, demonstrating the trade-offs between individual and consolidated querying approaches. While the NxN model offers flexibility, the N+N model is more efficient for scenarios with multiple buyers querying shared catalogs.
